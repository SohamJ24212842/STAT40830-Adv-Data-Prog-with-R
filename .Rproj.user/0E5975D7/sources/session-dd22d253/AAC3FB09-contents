## Introduction

The Tooth-Growth dataset, available in R, studies the impact of **vitamin C** on **tooth length** in guinea pigs. Two supplement types were tested: Orange Juice (OJ) and Ascorbic Acid (VC), across three dose levels: 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/day.

## Plotting the Data

Below is a boxplot showing how **tooth length** changes across different **dose levels** and **supplement types**.

```{r}
# Load libraries and data 
library(ggplot2) 
library(dplyr) 
library(knitr)
data(ToothGrowth)
```

```{r}
#Boxplot
ggplot(ToothGrowth, 
       aes(x = factor(dose), 
           y = len, fill = supp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "black") + 
  labs( title = "Tooth Length by Dose and Supplement Type", 
        x = "Dose (mg/day)", y = "Tooth Length (mm)", 
        fill = "Supplement Type" ) + theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
```

The boxplot illustrates how vitamin C dosages is directly proportional toÂ tooth growth. Notably:

-   Orange juice seems to work better than ascorbic acid at **0.5 mg per day**.

-   At **1.0 mg per day**, the difference decreases.

The effects of both supplements are comparable at **2.0 mg/day**.

These results imply that at low dosages, the mode of distribution is important, but at higher dosages, the total amount of vitamin C becomes the primary consideration.

## Descriptive Statistics

Summary of the tooth-length grouped by supplement type and dose:

```{r}
#Summary Table
ToothGrowth %>%
  group_by(supp, dose) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Length = round(mean(len), 2),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean Tooth Length by Supplement and Dose (mg/day)")

```

### Summary Explanation 

-   **Tooth length increases with dose** for both supplements.

```{=html}

```
-    **Orange Juice (OJ)** consistently leads to **higher tooth growth** than **Ascorbic Acid (VC)** at **0.5 mg** and **1.0 mg** doses.

```{=html}

```
-    At **2.0 mg/day**, both OJ and VC result in **similar mean tooth lengths** (\~26 mm), showing that the **effect of dose dominates** at higher levels.
